## Excel Auto-Paste

Just activate it and it will start watching your clipboard. Whenever some text is copied from any application, it will be pasted into your active worksheet. It will advance to the next cell:
 
- If the paste direction is set to _column_, it will automatically advance to the next row.
- If the paste direction is set to _row_, it will automatically advance to the next column.

This way you can just keep adding stuff to your spreadsheet without having to switch for pasting every time.

Text with line breaks and tabs are split and pasted to different rows and columns, respectively (as expected).
